## Purpose
This repository contains code for working with the Smartsheet and Quick Base APIs. These scripts intend to link automate workflows and analysis or add functionality that would be cumbersome to do manually.

## Getting Started
APIs (application programming interfaces) are communication protocols that allow computers to exchange information. You can find a great overview of APIs [here](https://zapier.com/learn/apis/).

Before you can work with APIs, you'll need to prove that you are who your computer says you are. This involves creating an account and authenticating your identity. You can register for Smartsheet's developer portal [here](https://developers.smartsheet.com/), and you can use your Quickbase credentials to access the Quickbase API.

## Resources
The following resources are helpful for working with the Smartsheet and Quick Base APIs.

- [Smartsheet API 2.0 Documentation](http://smartsheet-platform.github.io/api-docs/)
